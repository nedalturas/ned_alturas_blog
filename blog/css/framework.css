/* 
I need to import fonts to this and append it on the directory 
    
I am still deciding if I will proceed on using the lovella font 
but Din or General Sans looks great as well.

This blog must be minimal and easy to read also I need to add responsive
and dark mode feature before I do all the backend stuff.
